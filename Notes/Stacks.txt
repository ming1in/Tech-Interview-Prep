**Stacks**
  - A linear data structure that is based on the LIFO principle
    - LIFO: Last In, First Out

  - Typically Stacks are implemented using Arrays as well

  - For example, a 'Stack' of plates where you usually only add and remove plates
    from the top


**Operations of a Stack**
  - Stacks only have 2 basic operation
    - Push, adding a element to the top of the Stack
      - JS: push()
      
    - Pop, removing element from the top of the Stack
      - JS: pop()
