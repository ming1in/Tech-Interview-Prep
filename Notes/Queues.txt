**Queue**
  - A linear data structure that is based on the FIFO principle
    - FIFO: first in, first out

  - Typically Queues are implemented using Arrays

  - A good physical representation of a Queue is a line of people, where 
    the individual at the beginning of the line would be the first to leave


**Operations of a Queue**
  - Queues only have 2 basic operation
    - Enqueue, adding a element to the back of the Queue
      - JS: push()
    - Dequeue, removing element from the start of the Queue
      - JS: shift()
