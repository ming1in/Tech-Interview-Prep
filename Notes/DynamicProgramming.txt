**Dynamic Programming**
  - Typically during a dynamic programming questions there are 2 approaches:

    1. recursion & store (memoization AKA top-down)
      - if your recursive solutions has repeated steps, using memoization 
      should make your solution more efficient

    2. bottom up (tabulation)
      - approach that is built upon a base case and follows a relation until
      you reach the result.
