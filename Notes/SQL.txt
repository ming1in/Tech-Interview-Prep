** Relational Database Management Systems(RDBMS) ***

*** Identifiers ***
- Every row in a collection table has a primary key that should be universally unique.

- Types of identifers:
  - Foreign key: an identifer that is a primary key of a row in another table and can be used reference that row.
    - Row can contain multiple foreign keys to reference other rows in a table

  - Surrogate key: an identifer than has no relation to anything in the real-world

  - Natural key: an identifier that is derived from something in the real-world (i.e SSN)

  - Composite keys: an identifer that is a combination of items from two rows because one row is not able to 
    uniquely identify the row in the table
    - Sometime a composite key can be comprised of two primary keys


*** SQL(Structured Query Language) ***

- You can use SQL to:
  - Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)
  - Perform administrative task such as security, import/export

- SQL is a hybrid language, comprised of 4 types of languages
  - Data Query Language: used to query databases and retrieve data
