**Steps**
1. Online assessment: 7 question in Java/C++/C in 21min

2. Online assessment: virtual simulator of day at Amazon, review code, and debugging

3. Video Chat Interview: start with behavioral question, technical Q&A, and then 
   coding challenge. Should get a response 3-5 days later


**Behavior Q&A**
10/23/2020
- tell me about a time where you had to had to decide whether to stop or continue a project.
- Tell me about a time when a team project was not going well
 

**Technical Q&A**
10/23/2020
- What is a dictionary or hash?
- What is a binary search tree?
- What is a Breadth First Traversal and it worse case runtime?


**Key Notes**
- Amazon asks alot of questions about trees and runtimes
- Make sure to know the Leadership Principles at Amazon and weave them in behavior responses
 

**Post Interview Takeaways**
Video Chat Interview(Ming) | 10/23/2020 
- Interview with a Amazon SDE, Jennifer Yu, working in supply chain, building internal 
  software not consumer-facing work. Asked simply behavior questions that were based on 
  projects and experience I had on my resume. In the technical Q&A, she asked a lot of questions
  about trees specifically breadth first traversal, binary tree, big-O runtime. The coding challenge
  was to find the sum of nodes at the lowest depth. 
  
  I felt that I was able to answer the behavior questions and technical Q&A really well. I was able to 
  walk her through some cool projects such as fulament, serenity girls, and gedcom parser. I talked about
  I intrigued I was able Amazons culture and my knowledge of Amazon's history and Jeff Bezos. The interviewer
  told me about a really cool book about Amazon when she first started, thought that was really cool. During
  the coding challenge I feel that I articulated my thought process well and was able to clearly speak my mind.
  My first approach was overly complicated, but was able to pivot a simpler solutions use BFT and I think I 
  was on the right track when she nodded in approval. Ultimately, I was not able to solve the challenge completely,
  but I think I was going in the right direction and couldn't piece together the last bits.
